Hi Vin,

I hope this message finds you well. We’ve been closely following your work and are genuinely impressed by your skills and contributions. As a result, there’s been some discussion at the top about possibly relocating you to Australia to help us drive the company forward. Nothing is set in stone yet, but we wanted to give you a heads-up as we explore this exciting opportunity.

In the meantime, I need you to log in all developers currently working on the Kitty project. Your organizational skills are crucial for this phase, and I trust you’ll handle it smoothly.

Also, I wanted to let you know that we’ll start rolling out bonuses for you from time to time as a token of our appreciation for your hard work and dedication.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there’s anything you need from my end.

Cheers,

Patricia
