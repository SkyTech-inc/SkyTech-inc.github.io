Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to update you all on the current status of the Kittyproject. At this time, the project is on hold. We will be resuming our work as soon as the initial code is signed off and approved by our Senior Developer.

I understand that this might cause some delays, but it’s important to ensure everything is up to standard before we move forward. Rest assured, I’ll keep you informed about any progress and provide updates as soon as we have more information.

Thank you all for your patience and understanding.

Best regards,  
Patricia
